  This project is an RTOS implementation on STM32 to manage multitasking and firmware control using STM32CubeIDE and FreeRTOS. 🚀
</p>

---

## ✨ Features

- ⏲ **Task Scheduling**: Scheduling various tasks with RTOS.
- 💡 **Multitasking**: Running various tasks, such as ADC, UART, OLED, and Button.
- 🔄 **RTOS Integration**: Using preemptive multitasking and delay management features.

## 🛠 Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lailymau/RTOS-Making-Firmware.git
2. Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.
3. Configure the hardware according to the STM32 board you are using.
4. Build the project and flash the firmware to your STM32 device.

## 📝 Prerequisites
